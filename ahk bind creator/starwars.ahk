 Send, for etiquette and protocol.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Protocol? Why, its my primary function,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, sir. I am well-versed in all the customs-{Enter}

sleep 1000
 Send, - Of course you haven't, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Not in an environment such as this.{Enter}
sleep 1000

 Send, the binary language of moisture vaporators.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Vaporators? Sir, my first job{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, was programming binary load lifters...{Enter}

sleep 1000
 Send, in most respects.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Can you speak Bocce?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Of course I can, sir. It's like...{Enter}

sleep 1000
 Send, when your chores are done.{Enter}

 Send, This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.{Enter}
sleep 1000

sleep 1000
 Send, Excuse me, sir but that R2 unit{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, is in prime condition, a real bargain.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Uncle Owen, what about that one?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What about that blue one?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We'll take that one.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Yeah, take this away.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He really is in first-class condition.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I've worked with him before.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Here he comes.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Okay, let's go.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Now, don't you forget this.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Why I should stick my neck out for you...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, is quite beyond my capacity.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Thank the maker!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This oil bath is going to feel so good.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I've got such a bad case{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, of dust contamination I can barely move.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm never gonna get out of here.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Is there anything I might do to help?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, No. Not unless you can alter time...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, speed up the harvest,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, or teleport me off this rock.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I dont think so, sir. I'm only a droid, and{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, not very knowledgeable about such things...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Well, if there's a bright center to the universe,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, you're on the planet that its farthest from.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I see, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You can call me Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I see, Sir Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Just Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Oh. And I am C-3P0, human-cyborg relations.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Hello.{Enter}
sleep 1000

sleep 1000
 Send, like you boys have seen a lot of action.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, With all we've been through,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, sometimes I'm amazed...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, were in as good condition as we are,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, what with the rebellion and all.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You know of the rebellion{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, against the Empire?!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Thats how we came to be in your service,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, if you take my meaning, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Have you been in many battles?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Several, I think.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Actually, there's not much to tell.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm not much more than an interpreter...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and not very good at telling stories. Well,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, not at making them interesting, anyway.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Well, my little friend, you got something{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, jammed in here real good.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Were you on a Starcruiser or-{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You're my only hope.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What's this?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What is what"? He asked you a question.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What is that?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You're my only hope.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You're my only hope.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Oh. He says its nothing, sir. Merely{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Who is she? She's beautiful.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I think she was a passenger{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, on our last voyage.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, A person of some importance, I believe.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Our captain was attached to-{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Is there any more to this recording?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Behave yourself, R2.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Youre going to get us into trouble.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's all right. You can trust him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Hes our new master.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He says that he's the property{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, of Obi-Wan Kenobi...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, a resident of these parts{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and its a private message for him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, hes talking about.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Our last master was Captain Antilles.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, But with all we've been through...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, this little R2 unit has{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, become a bit eccentric.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Obi-Wan Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, what he's talking about?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Well, I dont know anyone named Obi-Wan,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He's kind of a strange old hermit.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I wonder who she is.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Sounds like she's in trouble.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I better play back the whole thing.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He says the restraining bolt{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, has short-circuited his recording system.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He suggests that if you remove the bolt...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, he might be able to play back{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the entire recording.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Hm? Oh, yeah. Well...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I guess you're too small{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to run away on me...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, if I take this off. Okay...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, There you go.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Wait a minute. Whered she go? Bring her{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, back. Play back the entire message.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What message?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The one youve just been playing!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The one you're carrying{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, inside your rusty innards.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Luke! Luke!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I'm sorry, sir...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, but he appears to have{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, picked up a slight flutter.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Here. See what you can do with him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'll be ghtback.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Just you reconsider{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, playing that message for him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, No, I dont think he likes you at all.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, No, I dont like you, either.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You know, I think that R2 unit{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, we bought might have been stolen.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What makes you think that?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Well, I stumbled across a recording{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, while I was cleaning him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He says he belongs to someone{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, called Obi-Wan Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I thought he might have meant old Ben.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Do you know what he's talking about?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I wonder if he's related to Ben.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - That Wizard's just a crazy old man.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Thatll be the end of it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It belongs to us now.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, But what if this Obi-Wan{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, comes looking for him?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He won't. I don't think he exists anymore.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He died about the same time as your father.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - He knew my father?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I told you to forget it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Your only concern is to prepare{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, those new droids for tomorrow.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, In the morning, I want them{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, up there on the south ridge...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - working on those condensers.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Yes, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I think those new droids{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, are gonna work out fine.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, In fact, I, uh, was also thinking{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, about our agreement...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, about me staying on another season?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, And if these new droids do work out,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I want to transmit my application...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - to the academy this year.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You mean the next semester...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - before the harvest?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Sure. There's more than enough droids.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Harvest is when I need you the most.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's only one season more.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This year we'll make enough on the harvest{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, that Ill be able to hire some more hands...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and then you can go to the academy next year.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You must understand I need you here, Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - But it's a whole nother year!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Look, it's only one more season.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Yeah, thats what you said{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, when Biggs and Tank left.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Where are you going?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Looks like I'm going nowhere.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I have to go finish cleaning those droids.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Owen, he can't stay here forever.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Most of his friends have gone.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - It means so much to him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Lukes just not a farmer, Owen.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He has too much of his father in him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, That's what I'm afraid of.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What are you doing hiding back there?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It wasn't my fault, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Please don't deactivate me.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I told him not to go,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Kept babbling on about his mission.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Oh, no.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, That R2 unit has always been a problem.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, These asteroids are getting{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, quite out of hand.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Even I can't understand{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, their logic at times.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, How could I be so stupid?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - It's too dangerous...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, with all the Sand People around.{Enter}
sleep 1000

sleep 1000
 Send, Where am I?{Enter}

 Send, before the Sand People return.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I don't think I can make it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You go on, Master Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, There's no sense in you risking yourself{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, on my account.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm done for.{Enter}

sleep 1000
 Send, He was a navigator on a spice freighter.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, That's what your uncle told you.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He didnt hold with your fathers ideals.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Thought he should have stayed here...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and not gotten involved.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You fought in the Clone Wars?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the same as your father.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I wish I'd known him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - He was the best star pilot in the galaxy...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and a cunning warrior.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I understand you've become{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, quite a good pilot yourself.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, And he was a good friend.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Which reminds me...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I have something here for you.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Your father wanted you to have this{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, when you were old enough...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, like your father did.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Sir, if you'll not be needing me,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'll close down for a while.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Sure. Go ahead.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - What is it?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Your father's lightsaber.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, An elegant weapon{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, for a more civilized age.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, For over a thousand generations,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the Jedi knights were the guardians...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, of peace and justice{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, in the old Republic...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, before the dark times...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, before the Empire.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, How did my father die?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, A young Jedi named Darth Vader...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, who was a pupil of mine{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, until he turned to evil...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, helped the Empire hunt down{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and destroy the Jedi knights.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He betrayed and murdered your father.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Now the Jedi are all but extinct.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Vader was seduced{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, by the dark side of the Force.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The Force?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's an energy eld created{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, by all living things.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It surrounds us, penetrates us,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, it binds the galaxy together.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Now lets see if we cant figure out{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, what you are, my little friend...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and where you come from.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I saw part of a message he w-{Enter}

sleep 1000
 Send, General Kenobi, years ago{Enter}

 Send, you served my father in the Clone Wars.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Now he begs you to help him{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, in his struggle against the Empire.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I regret that I am unable to present{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, my father's request to you in person.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, But my ship has fallen under attack...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and I am afraid my mission{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to bring you to Alderaan has failed.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I have placed information{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, vital to the survival of the rebellion...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, into the memory systems of this R2 unit.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, My father will know how to retrieve it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You must see this droid{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, safely delivered to him on Alderaan.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This is our most desperate hour.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You're my only hope.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You must learn the ways of the Force{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Alderaan?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm not going to Alderaan.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I've got to get home. It's late.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm in for it as it is.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I need your help, Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, She needs your help.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Im getting too old for this sort of thing.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I cant get involved.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I've got work to do.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it, but{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, theres nothing I can do about it right now.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - It's all such a long way from here.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Thats your uncle talking.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, My uncle.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, How am I ever gonna explain this?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Learn about the Force, Luke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You can get a transport there to{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Mos Eisley or wherever youre going.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You must do what you feel{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, is right, of course.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Until this battle station{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, is fully operational, we are vulnerable.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, They're more dangerous than you realize.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Dangerous to your star fleet, Commander...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, not to this battle station.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The rebellion will continue to gain support{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, in the Imperial Senate-{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The Imperial Senate will no longer{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, be of any concern to us.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I have just received word that the Emperor{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, has dissolved the council permanently.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The last remnants of the old Republic{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, have been swept away.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, That's impossible.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, How will the Emperor maintain control{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, without the bureaucracy?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The regional governors now have{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, direct control over their territories.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Fear will keep the local systems in line...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - fear of this battle station.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - And what of the rebellion?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, If the rebels have obtained a complete{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, technical readout of this station...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, it is possible, however unlikely, that{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, they might find a weakness and exploit it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The plans you refer to will{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, soon be back in our hands.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Any attack made by the rebels{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, against this station...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, would be a useless gesture, no matter{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, what technical data theyve obtained.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This station is now the ultimate power{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, in the universe.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I suggest we use it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Dont be too proud of this{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, technological terror you've constructed.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The ability to destroy a{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, planet is insignificant...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, next to the power of the Force.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Don't try to frighten us with{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, your sorcerers ways, Lord Vader.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Your sad devotion{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to that ancient religion...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, has not helped you conjure up{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the stolen data tapes...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, or given you clairvoyance enough{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to find the rebels hidden fortr...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I find your lack of faith disturbing.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Enough of this.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Vader, release him.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, As you wish.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This bickering is pointless.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Lord Vader will provide us with{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the location of the rebel fortress...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, by the time this station is operational.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We will then crush the rebellion{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, with one swift stroke.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It looks like the Sand People{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, did this, all right.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Look. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's just, I've never heard of them{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, hitting anything this big before.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, They didnt...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, but we are meant to think they did.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, These tracks are side-by-side.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Sand People always ride single file...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to hide their numbers.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, These are the same Jawas{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, that sold us R2 and 3P0.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, And these blast points,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, too accurate for Sand People.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Only Imperial stormtroopers{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, are so precise.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, But why would Imperial troops{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, want to slaughter Jawas?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, If they traced the robots here, they{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, may have learned who they sold them to...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and that would lead them back... home!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Uncle Owen!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, And now, Your Highness, we will discuss{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the location of your hidden rebel base.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Theres nothing you could{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, have done, Luke, had you been there.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You'd have been killed, too, and the droids{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, would now be in the hands of the Empire.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I want to come with you to Alderaan.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Theres nothing for me here now.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I want to learn the ways of the Force...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and become a Jedi like my father.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Mos Eisley spaceport.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You will never find a more{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, wretched hive of scum and villainy.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We must be cautious.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - How long have you had these droids?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - About three or four seasons.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Theyre up for sale if you want them.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Let me see your identification.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You don't need to see his identification.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - We don't need to see his identification.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - These arent the droids you're looking for.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, These aren't the droids were looking for.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He can go about his business.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You can go about your business.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Move along.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Move along. Move along.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I cant abide those Jawas.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Disgusting creatures!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Go on, go on.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I can't understand how we got by{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, those troops. I thought we were dead.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The Force can have a strong influence{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, on the weak-minded.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Do you really think we're gonna find a{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, pilot here thatll take us to Alderaan?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Most of the best freighter pilots{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, are to be found here...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, only watch your step.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, This place can be a little rough.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm ready for anything.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Come along, R2.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Hey! We don't serve their kind here.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - What?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We dont want them here.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Why dont you wait out by the speeder?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We don't want any trouble.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I heartily agree with you, sir.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'll have one of those.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - He doesn't like you.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - I'm sorry.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I dont like you, either.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I have the death sentence on 12 systems.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'll be careful.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Youll be dead!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - This little ones not worth the effort.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Come, let me get you something.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, No blasters! No blasters!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm all right.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Chewbacca here is rst mate{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, on a ship that might suit us.{Enter}

 Send, Han Solo. I'm captain{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, of the Millennium Falcon.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Chewie here tells me you're looking{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, for passage to the Alderaan system.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Fast ship? You've never heard{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, of the Millennium Falcon?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Should I have?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's the ship that made the Kessel run{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, in less than 12 parsecs.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I've outrun Imperial star ships.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm talking about{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the big Corellian ships now.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Shes fast enough for you, old man.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - What's the cargo?{Enter}

 Send, Myself, the boy, two droids...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, and no questions asked.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, What is it, some kind of local trouble?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Let's just say we'd like to avoid...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, any Imperial entanglements.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Well, thats the real trick, isn't it?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, And it's gonna cost you something extra.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Ten thousand, all in advance.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Ten thousand?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We could almost buy our own ship for that!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - You bet I could.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I'm not such a bad pilot myself.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, We dont have to sit here and listen...{Enter}

 Send, Now be careful, R2.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, He made a fair move.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Screaming about it can't help you.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Let him have it. It's not wise{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, to upset a Wookiee.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, But, sir, nobody worries{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, about upsetting a droid.{Enter}

 Send, - I call it luck.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, In my experience,{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, theres no such thing as luck.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, against the living, that's something else.{Enter}

 Send, Thats good. Youve taken your{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, first step into a larger world.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Yes?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, They found the remains of a rebel base...{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, but they estimate that it has{Enter}
sleep 1000

sleep 1000
 Send, They are now conducting an extensive{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, search of the surrounding systems.{Enter}

 Send, She lied. She lied to us!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, I told you she would never{Enter}

 Send, Terminate her... immediately.{Enter}

 Send, Some kind of asteroid collision.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's not on any of the chants.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - What's going on?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - What do you mean? Where is it?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.{Enter}

 Send, It aint there. It's{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, been totally blown away.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - What? How?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Destroyed by the Empire.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, The entire star fleet couldn't destroy{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, the whole planet.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It would take a thousand ships{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, with more firepower than I've-{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Theres another ship coming in.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - Maybe they know what happened.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - It's an Imperial fighter.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - It followed us!{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, - No. It's a short-range fighter.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, There arent any bases around here.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Where did it come from?{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It sure is leaving in a big hurry.{Enter}

 Send, If they identify us, we're in big trouble.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Not if I can help it.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Chewie, jam its transmissions.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It would be as well to let it go.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, It's too far out of range.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, Not for long.{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, A ghter that size couldn't get{Enter}
sleep 1000
 Send, this deep into space on its own.{Enter}

 Send, long enough to tell anybody about us.{Enter}

 Send, to all this sneakin around.{Enter}
